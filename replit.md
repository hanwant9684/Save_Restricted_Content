# Telegram Media Bot - Replit Setup

## Overview
This project is a Telegram bot designed to download and forward media from private and public Telegram channels. Its primary purpose is to offer media forwarding with advanced features such as queue management, a premium user system, and ad monetization integration. The bot leverages Telethon for Telegram interaction and includes a WSGI server for handling ad verification, aiming to provide a robust and monetizable media sharing solution.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Telegram Client:** Telethon
- **Web Server:** Waitress (WSGI server)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Event Loop:** uvloop

### Core Features & Design Decisions

1.  **Media Handling:**
    *   **Queue Management:** Implements a download queue with concurrency control.
    *   **Efficient Media Group Downloads:** Processes media group files sequentially (download, upload, delete) to prevent high RAM usage, uploading them as individual messages rather than grouped albums for memory efficiency.
    *   **Hybrid Transfer Approach (Nov 2025):**
        *   **Downloads:** Uses Telethon's native streaming (`client.iter_download()`) for single-connection, chunk-by-chunk downloads that minimize RAM usage and prevent spikes on constrained environments like Render.
        *   **Uploads:** Continues using FastTelethon with optimized parallel connections (3-6 connections based on file size) for faster upload speeds while maintaining RAM efficiency.
        *   This hybrid approach provides the best balance between speed and memory safety, preventing crashes on Render's free tier while maintaining good performance.

2.  **User & Session Management:**
    *   **Authentication & Access Control:** Features a user authentication and permission system, including phone-based authentication for restricted content.
    *   **Session Pooling:** Manages user sessions with a maximum of 3 concurrent sessions and a 30-minute idle timeout.
    *   **Smart Session Eviction:** Protects active downloads by only evicting idle sessions when all slots are busy, ensuring uninterrupted user experience.
    *   **Legal Acceptance System:** Requires users to accept Terms & Conditions and a Privacy Policy (compliant with Indian and international laws) before using bot features, with acceptance stored persistently in the database.

3.  **Monetization & Ads:**
    *   **Ad Verification System:** Provides ad verification capabilities for monetization (URL shortener integration has been retired).
    *   **Two-Step Verification:** Employs a landing page with a "Get Verification Code" button for ad verification.

4.  **System Stability & Optimization:**
    *   **RAM Optimization:** Implemented comprehensive memory optimizations including tiered connection scaling, asynchronous background tasks (using `asyncio.create_task`), and optimized data structures for memory monitoring.
    *   **Tier-Based File Cleanup (Nov 2025):** Smart cleanup system that waits before deleting files to ensure proper cache/chunk clearing:
        *   **Premium Users:** 2-second wait for optimal performance
        *   **Free Users:** 5-second wait to ensure complete cache/chunk cleanup on constrained environments
        *   This prevents RAM spikes and crashes on Render by allowing Telethon and file system to fully clear internal buffers and temporary data
    *   **Cloud-Only Backup:** Simplifies backup strategy to use only GitHub for database persistence, with automatic backups every 10 minutes.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Includes graceful shutdown mechanisms and proper background task tracking to prevent resource leaks and errors like "Task was destroyed but it is pending!".
    *   **SQLite Database:** Chosen for its portability and low resource footprint.
    *   **Waitress WSGI Server:** Selected over Flask for its minimal RAM consumption.
    *   **uvloop:** Used for performance enhancement of the event loop.
