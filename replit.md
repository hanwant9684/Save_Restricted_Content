# Telegram Media Bot - Replit Setup

## Overview
This project is a Telegram bot designed to download and forward media from private and public Telegram channels. Its primary purpose is to offer media forwarding with advanced features such as queue management, a premium user system, and ad monetization integration. The bot leverages Telethon for Telegram interaction and includes a WSGI server for handling ad verification, aiming to provide a robust and monetizable media sharing solution.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Telegram Client:** Telethon
- **Web Server:** Waitress (WSGI server)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Event Loop:** uvloop

### Core Features & Design Decisions

1.  **Media Handling:**
    *   **Queue Management:** Implements a download queue with concurrency control.
    *   **Efficient Media Group Downloads:** Processes media group files sequentially (download, upload, delete) to prevent high RAM usage, uploading them as individual messages rather than grouped albums for memory efficiency.
    *   **Tiered Connection Scaling:** Dynamically adjusts download connections based on file size (e.g., 4 connections for files ≥1GB, 8 for files <200MB) to optimize RAM usage.
    *   **Fast Downloads:** Utilizes FastTelethon for accelerated media transfers.

2.  **User & Session Management:**
    *   **Authentication & Access Control:** Features a user authentication and permission system, including phone-based authentication for restricted content.
    *   **Session Pooling:** Manages user sessions with a maximum of 3 concurrent sessions and a 30-minute idle timeout.
    *   **Smart Session Eviction:** Protects active downloads by only evicting idle sessions when all slots are busy, ensuring uninterrupted user experience.
    *   **Legal Acceptance System:** Requires users to accept Terms & Conditions and a Privacy Policy (compliant with Indian and international laws) before using bot features, with acceptance stored persistently in the database.

3.  **Monetization & Ads:**
    *   **Ad Verification System:** Integrates various URL shorteners (e.g., SwiftLnx, UpShrink, Shrtfly, GPLinks) for ad monetization.
    *   **Two-Step Verification:** Employs a landing page with a "Get Verification Code" button to prevent premature code generation by URL shortener validation.

4.  **System Stability & Optimization:**
    *   **RAM Optimization:** Implemented comprehensive memory optimizations including tiered connection scaling, asynchronous background tasks (using `asyncio.create_task`), and optimized data structures for memory monitoring.
    *   **Cloud-Only Backup:** Simplifies backup strategy to use only GitHub for database persistence, with automatic backups every 10 minutes.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Includes graceful shutdown mechanisms and proper background task tracking to prevent resource leaks and errors like "Task was destroyed but it is pending!".
    *   **SQLite Database:** Chosen for its portability and low resource footprint.
    *   **Waitress WSGI Server:** Selected over Flask for its minimal RAM consumption.
    *   **uvloop:** Used for performance enhancement of the event loop.
